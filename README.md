The code analyzes a concrete dataset to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on various ingredients and factors. It starts by loading the data and performing initial statistical analysis and visualizations. Outliers in the data are identified and removed to improve model accuracy. New features, such as the cement-to-water ratio, are created to enhance the model. A linear regression model is built, and its assumptions are validated through various statistical tests. The model's performance is evaluated, and it is saved for future use. Finally, an interactive user interface is created using Gradio, allowing users to input values and get predictions for compressive strength.
